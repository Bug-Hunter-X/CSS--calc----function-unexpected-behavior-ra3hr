The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if the calculation is too complex.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 50px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 50%);` will lead to unexpected behavior because it is trying to subtract a percentage from a percentage. Another common issue is forgetting to correctly escape special characters within `calc()` values if they are used as string variables.
